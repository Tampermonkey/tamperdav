###### README versions: [EN](README.md) | [pt-BR](doc/lang/pt-BR/README_pt-BR.md)

---

A WebDAV-like server to sync Tampermonkey scripts and edit them with an external editor.

> **WARNING:** this is not a 100% WebDAV-compliant server. Many clients should, but don't necessarily have to work!

# Usage

Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) greater than v4.9 is installed.

## Windows

execute ```TamperDAV.bat```

## Linux

``` sh
$ ./tamperdav.sh
```


# Clients

## Tampermonkey (4.7.5823+)

Notes:
 * in order to allow Tampermonkey to use the full TamperDAV feature set, please make sure TamperDAV is **running** when Tampermonkey is started.
 * Tampermonkey will sync all scripts into a subfolder of the configured dav-directory i.e. ```Tampermonkey/sync``` using it's internally generated UUID for the filename. The actual file to edit can easily be found by running `node find_script_in_meta.js --name="My Script Name"`. Alternatively you can find the the UUID via Tampermonkey's UI by navigating to the script and retrieving it from the address bar.
